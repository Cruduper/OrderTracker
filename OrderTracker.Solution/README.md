# _Pierre's Bakery Order Tracker_

#### By _**Eric Crudup**_

#### _An application for creating and managing orders_

## Technologies Used

* _C#_
* _.NET_
* _MSTest_
* _Markdown_

## Description

_This was built as the second C# project in my coding bootcamp. This application is the successor to our first C# project called Pierre's bakery. It uses classes and testing from the previous project and expands upon it by using RESTful routing and Razor to dynamically create objects, URL links and page text.  It also explores classes, using directives, testing, methods, encapsulation, and abstraction.

The user create new vendors, and add multiple orders specific to each vendor, and view details about individual vendors or orders on dynamically created pages._


## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _clone git repository to a local machine_
* _navigate to root folder of the project using command line_

#### _To Run Tests_
* _navigate to testing folder (OrderTracker.Tests for this repo) using command line_
* _type in 'dotnet restore' command_
* _type in 'dotnet test' while still in OrderTracker.Tests folder to run tests_
#### _To Run Program_
* _navigate to folder with Program.cs file (OrderTracker in this repo) using command line_
* _type in 'dotnet build' command_
* _type in 'dotnet run' command_
* _get awesome_

## Known Bugs and issues

* _No known bugs_
* _Issue: code would have been marginally easier to read and easier to extend had I given my Vendor and Order classes "id" properties in order to easily identify specific vendors and orders. As this is a learning project and not production code, I chose to purposely make the assignment more challenging and truly test my newfound knowledge of Razor and logical program flow by omitting these extremely useful properties.
